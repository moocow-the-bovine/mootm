ChangeLog for package mootm

2.0.5 Fri, 02 Dec 2005 17:34:16 +0100
        + added abstract underlying FSM library support: new default is gfsm

2.0.3 Sun, 08 Aug 2004 16:45:39 +0200
	+ changed copyright policy for lib to LGPL-2.1
	+ added COPYING.LIB
	+ bugfix for moot-2.0.4-pre2
	
2.0.2 Fri, 09 Jul 2004 01:02:30 +0200
	+ changed to jive with moot 2.0.0 API
	+ added 'static' build target
	  - major hack required for libFSM<->libFSMTools interdependence
	    * must double-link libFSM:
	         ld ... -lFSM .. -lFSMTools ... -lFSM ...
	    * Problem: libtool is too smart for poorly (im(ns)ho)
	      designed libraries: it assumes truly modular libraries,
	      mangling the above call into:
	         ld ... -lFSMTools -lFSM ...
	    * Hack:
	      ~ added symlink in /usr/local/lib :
		 libFSMStaticHack.a->libFSM.a
	      ~ added configure argument '--enable-all-static'
	        to handle the logic, so we end up calling:
	         ld ... -lFSM ... -lFSMTools ... -lFSMStaticHack ...
	
2.0.1 Thu, 10 Jun 2004 20:17:07 +0200
	+ added support for fsmlib 0.1.x
	  - tested version calls itself 0.1.1.1, which it
	    seems to have been doing for about a year
	    of (active?) development now... odd, that.
	+ removed tag-extraction and auto-dequote support
	  - mootTokenLexer should take care of that for
	    us now, providing no conventions change unexpectedly
	    (ha!)
	
2.0.0 Fri, 21 May 2004 13:36:16 +0200
	+ revised to use 'mootToken' interface
	+ original version, extracted from 'moot'
