ChangeLog for package mootm

2.0.1 Thu, 10 Jun 2004 20:17:07 +0200
	+ added support for fsmlib 0.1.x
	  - tested version calls itself 0.1.1.1, which it
	    seems to have been doing for about a year
	    of (active?) development now... odd, that.
	+ removed tag-extraction and auto-dequote support
	  - mootTokenLexer should take care of that for
	    us now, providing no conventions change unexpectedly
	    (ha!)
	
2.0.0 Fri, 21 May 2004 13:36:16 +0200
	+ revised to use 'mootToken' interface
	+ original version, extracted from 'moot'
